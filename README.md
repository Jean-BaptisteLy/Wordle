## Organisation
The code is divided in 3 modules, and the database :

* `play_daily_wordle.py` allows to play the daily word game (or another word you choose)
* `play_wordle.py` allows to play yourself
* `Wordle Answers.txt` is the database
  
It is accompanied with a Jupyter Notebook testing the code, not playing.
